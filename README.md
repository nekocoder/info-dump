[Hacking Game ("System Defense", "Children of "?)
Goal
> Connect to target core. Take control. 

Main mechanic(s)
> deploy and fortify information obstacles
> probe and take control of enemy information obstacles.

resources
> single-use drones [specialization;specialization]
> multi-use drones [multi-function, moderate stats; mid/high tier]
> Barriers [resists junk data; slows down data transmission one way]
> Sensors [passive observation; can't initiate action on own]
> ping []
> junk data transmission [can overwelm structures; can cause bottle necks, easily trips alarms] 
> data injection [can infiltrate and engage systems; higher chance of revealing your own systems]

random ideas
> DNS server communication
